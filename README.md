# Minimal Sophus/Ceres autodiff vs numeric example

Using Ceres to minimize the cost function, it works fine using numeric derivatives but not automatic.

## Cost function
A B-spline in SE3 defines a camera trajectory.
Now we want to find the spline (its knots) such that

1. The world point `Xw = (5, 1, 3)` has local spline/camera coordinate `Xs = (0, 0, 1)`.
1. The angular velocity is a constant rotation around the x-axis.

I.e. The cameras trajectory is circular with `Xw` as its center point.

The spline is implemented according to the description in

## Building

Except for the usual things to build a Ceres project, you need the Sophus package for SE(3) representations.
